# Brain-MRI-scans-classification-for-tumor
## Overview
This repository contains code for training a deep learning model to detect brain tumors in MRI scans. The model is trained on a dataset containing MRI images of both positive and negative cases. The trained model can be used to predict whether a given MRI scan is positive or negative for a brain tumor.
## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model can be downloaded from Kaggle: [Brain Tumor Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection). It contains two subdirectories: 'yes' and 'no,' each containing MRI images of positive and negative cases, respectively. 
Or you can use API key=kaggle datasets download -d ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection
